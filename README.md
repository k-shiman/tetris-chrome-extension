## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** – canvas structure and UI layout  
- **CSS3** – responsive design, custom themes, and styling  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – core game logic, rendering, controls, and state management  
- **Canvas API** – rendering the grid, tetrominoes, ghost piece, and next preview  
- **Chrome Extension API (Manifest V3)** – packaged as a browser extension

## 🎮 How It Works

The game launches inside a 260x600px popup. Controls are keyboard-based, with clickable UI for theme switching, difficulty setting, and pause. The UI is optimized to fit inside the Chrome extension popup with smooth interactions and no scroll behavior.
